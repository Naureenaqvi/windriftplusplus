# Contributing to WinDrift++

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document outlines the process for reporting bugs, requesting features, and submitting code changes.

---

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/windrift_pp.git
   cd windrift_pp
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install pytest pytest-cov
   ```
4. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Reporting Bugs

Please open a GitHub Issue and include:

- Python version and OS
- Full error traceback
- Minimal reproducible example
- Expected vs. actual behaviour

---

## Requesting Features

Open a GitHub Issue with the label `enhancement`. Describe:

- The use case motivating the feature
- How it relates to the paper (if applicable)
- Any relevant references

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Ensure all existing tests pass: `pytest tests/`
2. Add tests for any new functionality
3. Follow the code style described below
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`
5. Submit the PR with a clear title and description referencing any related Issues

---

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use descriptive variable names that match the paper's notation where applicable (e.g. `ecdf_h` for F̂H, `d_crit` for Dc)
- Keep functions focused — one responsibility per function
- Add docstrings to all public functions referencing the relevant equation number from the paper

---

## Project Structure Conventions

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Code/` | Source modules only — no notebooks, no scripts |
| `Datasets/` | Synthetic CSVs — generated by `data_generator.py` |
| `Results/` | Generated output — not committed except summary CSVs |
| `tests/` | Pytest test files matching `test_<module>.py` |

---

## Academic Integrity

This codebase implements a published algorithm. Any changes that affect algorithmic behaviour (ECDF calculation, test statistics, window logic, voting) must reference the relevant equation or section from the paper in both the code docstring and the PR description.
